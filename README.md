# About the Game

A Felis catus species spinoff on the classic 1980s Space Invaders arcade game. Shoot the incoming meteorite invaders from outer space using your spacecraft's lasers. All while trying to avoid their blasts under Commander Paws' directions. I mean it's cats and lasers. Do you need to know any more?
